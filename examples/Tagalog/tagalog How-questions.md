Schachter, Paul, and Fe T. Otanes. *Tagalog Reference Grammar*.
Berkeley: University of California Press, 1972.

 

The various questions that are in English constructed using ‘how’ show
an interesting lexicalisation structure in Tagalog (Schachter & Otanes,
1972:514-516). There are five Tagalog lexemes that appear to be
relevant:

•   *kumusta* (from Spanish *comó**está*)

•   *paano*

•   *gaano*

•   *ilan*

•   *magkano*

*kumusta* is the interrogative that asks for the quality of something
(514). Note that it does not seem to be alike to English *what kind of*
questions. A more suitable translation seems to be something like “what
kind of word would you use to describe X”:

*paano* is the interrogative for MANNER-questions (514-515):

*gaano* is used for EXTENT-questions, like English *how*+adjective or
*how*+adverb (515):

*gaano* is also used for MASS QUANTITY-questions, like English *how
much* (515):

*ilan* is the interrogative for COUNT QUANTITY-questions, like English
*how many* (516):

*magkano* is also translatable into English as *how much*, but it
specifically asks for the PRICE of something (516):
